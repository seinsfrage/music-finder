App allows users to:
1) search for an artist;
2) find that artist and two similar artists (based on intitial artist search), and play top hit of any of those artists via embedded Spotify players; and
3) find if any three of those artists is playing a live show based on City, State search parameters (displayed via Google Maps)

Initial app was hampered by: 1) needing to use free APIs (5 total were used; async AJAX calls were a challenge) and 2) timeframe allowed for conception to completion (1 week; a couple of responses for API keys arrived too late).
